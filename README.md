## Description
Welcome to the To-Do App Project! This repository contains the code for a simple and efficient To-Do application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
This project enhanced my front-end development skills, particularly in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
It allows users to manage their tasks efficiently by adding, editing, and deleting to-do items. 
The app is designed to be user-friendly and visually appealing, leveraging modern web technologies for an optimal experience.

## Features
- **Add Tasks**: Users can add new tasks to their to-do list.
- **Delete Tasks**: Users can remove tasks from their to-do list.
- **Mark Tasks as Completed**: Users can mark tasks as completed to keep track of their progress.
- **Persistent Storage**: Tasks are stored in the browser's local storage, so they persist across page reloads.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: Structure of the web application.
- **CSS**: Styling and layout of the app.
- **JavaScript**: Functionality and interactivity of the app.
